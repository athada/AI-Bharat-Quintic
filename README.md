# Team Quintic: AI for Bharat Hackathon

## Team Information
* **Team Name:** Quintic
* **Agent Name:** Kalyan Agent
* **Team Leader:** Ayush Thada
* **Team Member:** Aanchal Kandpal

### Why "Quintic"?
We chose the name **Quintic** (referring to a degree-5 polynomial) because it represents the **five critical layers** of our solution that must work in perfect harmony to solve the complex equation of rural economics:
1.  **Identity:** Verifying the user (The Document Doctor).
2.  **Rights:** Securing government benefits (Welfare).
3.  **Revenue:** Unlocking market access (Commerce).
4.  **Reasoning:** The AI brain bridging the gap (Bedrock).
5.  **Resilience:** The durable infrastructure holding it all together (Step Functions).

Just as a quintic equation has complex solutions, our team solves the complex, multi-dimensional problems of rural Bharat with a unified, elegant formula.

## Project Documentation

This repository contains two key architectural documents generated for the hackathon submission:

### 1. `requirements.md`
* **Purpose:** Defines the functional and non-functional requirements of the Kalyan Agent.
* **Contents:** Details the user personas, core features (like the Document Doctor and Voice-to-Catalog), and the necessary system capabilities (Security, Scalability, and Vernacular Support).

### 2. `design.md`
* **Purpose:** Outlines the technical architecture and system design.
* **Contents:** Provides a deep dive into the 5-layer AWS architecture, data flow diagrams (from WhatsApp to Bedrock), and the specific technology stack (Step Functions, Kendra, Textract) used to build a resilient, serverless solution.

## What is "Quintic"? (The Science Behind the Name)

Our team name isn't just a label; it is a metaphor for solving **complexity at the frontier**.

### 1. The Algebraic Frontier
In mathematics, a **Quintic equation** (a polynomial of degree 5) is the first level of complexity that **cannot** generally be solved by simple formulas (radicals).
* **The Metaphor:** Just as the quintic equation represents a leap in mathematical difficulty that requires new tools (like Group Theory), the problems of Rural Bharat—fragmented identity, vernacular barriers, and policy disconnects—are too complex for standard linear solutions. They require a higher-order, agentic approach.

### 2. The Bridge Between Worlds (Calabi-Yau Manifolds)
In **String Theory** and **Quantum Mechanics**, the **Quintic Threefold** is the most famous example of a **Calabi-Yau manifold**.
* **Hidden Dimensions:** String theory predicts extra dimensions of space. To match our reality, these dimensions must be "compactified" into complex shapes. The Quintic manifold is the shape that hides these dimensions while preserving the laws of physics.
* **Mirror Symmetry:** The Quintic manifold was central to the discovery of **Mirror Symmetry**, a phenomenon where two completely different geometric shapes give rise to the exact same physical reality.

### 3. Our Mission
We adopted this name because our agent acts as a **Quintic Manifold for the Indian Economy**:
* It **compactifies the complexity** of 5,000+ government schemes and legal compliances into a simple, 6-dimensional "hidden" layer that the user never has to see.
* It creates a **Mirror Symmetry** between two distinct worlds: the chaotic, informal reality of a **Rural Artisan** and the structured, digital rigidity of **ONDC/Banking Protocols**.

**Quintic** is the invisible geometry that allows these two parallel worlds to coexist and interact seamlessly.
